Gibber
====================================================================================================

This is (currently) an old Perl script I wrote to generate English gibberish, primarily intended to
inspire pronouncable (and hence memorable) gibberish for passwords. It reads in the dictionary file
and then generates words 5-10 characters in length.

I'd like to come back to this script at some point, write it in C++, and possibly try out some other
methods for generating gibberish. Seems like it would be a fun machine-learning project.
